## CompoundHabits
App designed to make habit tracking easy, using just natural language.


## Developing

Once you've cloned the project on your machine and installed dependencies with  `pnpm install`, start a development server:

```sh
pnpm dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
pnpm build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
